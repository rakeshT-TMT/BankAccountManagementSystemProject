Project name: BASIC BANK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
I developed a basic Bank Account Management System in Java that performs the following operations:
1. Open an account.
2. Deposit money.
3. Withdrawal money.
4. Check account balance.
5. Calculate interest(only for savings accounts).
6. View Account Summaries and Reports.

The system follows:
1. Modular design using the DAO Pattern.
2. Interact with a relational database for managing account.
3. Object-Oriented programming principles.
4. Utilize Collections and Exception Handling.
5. Naming conventions.
