Project name: BASIC BANK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is a simple bank management system designed to handle basic banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, checking balance, calculating interest, and generating reports. The system uses a DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for interacting with the database, and implements various banking operations through a service layer.
I developed a basic Bank Account Management System in Java that performs the following operations:
1. Open an account.
2. Deposit money.
3. Withdrawal money.
4. Check account balance.
5. Calculate interest(only for savings accounts).
6. View Account Summaries and Reports.

The system follows:
1. Modular design using the DAO Pattern.
2. Interact with a relational database for managing account.
3. Object-Oriented programming principles.
4. Utilize Collections and Exception Handling.
5. Naming conventions. 
6. SQL Database.
7. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).



This project simulates basic bank operations including:

1. Account creation with an initial deposit
2. Depositing money into an account
3. Withdrawing money from an account
4. Checking the balance of an account
5. Calculating interest for savings accounts
6. Generating account and transaction reports
The system is built using Java and follows a modular structure, using DAO and service layers for separation of concerns.
